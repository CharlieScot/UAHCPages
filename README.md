SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF IMDB USING CNN AND RNN

Here's why using a hybrid of CNN and RNN for sentiment analysis on a dataset like IMDB is a good idea:

Strengths of Individual Models:

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks):

.-Pattern Recognition: They excel at identifying sentiment-laden phrases and keywords like "terrible acting" or "laugh-out-loud funny." These are common in movie reviews and can be strong indicators of sentiment.

.-Focus on Key Words: CNNs don't necessarily need to understand the entire sentence structure, just the presence of these key sentiment indicators. This is beneficial for casual language and slang in the IMDB dataset.

RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):

1.-Context Awareness: Unlike CNNs, RNNs can understand the sequence and order of words in a sentence. This is crucial because sentiment can depend on word order. For instance, "not bad" has a different meaning than "bad not."

2.-Long-range Dependencies: RNNs, especially LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), can handle long-distance dependencies. Sentiment can sometimes be influenced by words far apart in a review. RNNs can learn these longer-range relationships.

Benefits of the Hybrid Approach:

Combined Strengths: By combining CNNs and RNNs, you leverage the advantages of both: CNNs capture sentiment indicators. RNNs provide context and understand word order's impact.

Improved Accuracy: This combined approach can potentially lead to a more accurate sentiment analysis model. The model can capture both the presence of sentiment indicators and the overall flow of the review.
